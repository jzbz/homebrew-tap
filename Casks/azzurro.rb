# Homebrew cask for Azzurro.
#
# This file exists twice and update-cask.sh keeps the two in step: the template
# at packaging/homebrew/azzurro.rb in the app repo, which versions with the thing
# it describes, and the published cask at github.com/jzbz/homebrew-tap in
# Casks/azzurro.rb, which is that template with the release's version and hash
# filled in.
#
#   brew install --cask jzbz/tap/azzurro
#
# A tap rather than homebrew-cask because homebrew-cask applies a notability
# bar, and at 3x for a self-submission that is 225 stars, 90 forks or 90
# watchers, plus a 30-day repository age. A tap has none of that. What a tap
# does NOT escape is Gatekeeper: brew applies com.apple.quarantine on install
# whatever tap a cask came from, --no-quarantine was removed in Homebrew 4.7,
# and the `quarantine` stanza no longer exists in the DSL. So the notarized
# zip is what makes this work — an unsigned one would install and then refuse
# to open, which is worse than not offering it.

  # Complete, unlike the cask this was modeled on. rPGP holds secret keys and
  # so had to leave its store behind; nothing here is irreplaceable. The four
  # config files are a list of players seen, saved searches, custom stations
  # and the sidebar order, and the cache is downloaded cover art — all of it
  # rebuilt by using the app, and none of it worth surprising someone with by
  # leaving it on disk after they asked for everything to go.
